# ECE285 Compression Final Project

Description
This code is part of ECE285 Final Project developed by Alakh Desai and Nilesh Prasad Pandey.
It performs network prunning, weights sharing and huffman encoding on the weights for the compression.

## Code organization
- **main.py:** This is main driver code which performs all the said technique in the given Network.
- **model.py:** Defines the structure of the Network to be used. (in this case LeNet-300-100).
- **utils.py:** Contain all the custom functions used for compressing the weigths.
- **saves:** This folder contains all intermediate weights of the network. 
- **encodings:** This folder contains all the final binary files of the encoded weigths. 

## Requirments
- **python3.6+**
- **pip3**

**Install Requirments by:** *'pip3 install -r requirments.txt'*
